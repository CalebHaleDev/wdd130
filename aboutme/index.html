            <p>I love learning about all sorts of things, but I'm especially passionate about science, math, and programming. I am single, do some web development work with my sister, and am studying at BYU-Idaho for an Associates degree, but would like to study at a much higher level eventually. My hopes and dreams include creating webgames, creating a computer game, writing books, and more.</p>
            <p>I live in Boise, Idaho with my family and enjoy spending time with them and working on projects with them. I am also very interested in languages and education, especially in STEM topics, so I hope to create meaningful and educational webgames for free, as well as a multiplayer computer game, someday. I know a little of a lot of languages but am only fluent in English and Spanish.</p>
