        <div class="primary-section"><img src="images/linkedin_profile_image.jpeg" alt="profile picture">    
<p>I am a very curious person who loves learning things. I am intrigued by many science and math topics, but I also love creative writing and have planned and written on a lot of stories. I have not yet published any, but might do so in the future. I write primarily fiction but my studies often lead me to the most fundamental parts of reality I can find, like quantum mechanics and advanced, abstract math topics. I look forward to coming to understand the big questions of the universe someday, but in the meantime, I want to make a positive difference in the world, teaching and serving others. You can check out some of my accomplishments on <a href="linkedin.com/in/caleb-hale-curious/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="github.com/CalebHaleDev">Github</a>, or the other tabs in the menu above. And of course, I made this website. You can also see <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/caleb-hale/personal-introduction?authuser=0">my Google Site I made</a> during my education courses for my TESOL certificate.
