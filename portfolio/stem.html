            I am very interested in Math and Science. For years I have watched channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown">3Blue1Brown</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium">Veritasium</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MinutePhysics">minutephysics</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@standupmaths">Stand-up Maths</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SteveMould">Steve Mould</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@smartereveryday">SmarterEveryDay</a> on YouTube. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B0K50hursgBmtGIKEzxxWWazqJKvu3lG9jzKSz_vIIw/edit?usp=drive_link">One of my major papers I wrote</a> for one of my college classes was about the nature of math. Now that I'm older and have learned more, I've begun supplementing my hobby-watching with reading academic papers and taking college courses, and I plan to keep learning more for many years to come and looking for innovative ways to use what I learn.

            I hope to learn how to make web-applets and web-games for my own use and to help others learn concepts which don't have satisfactory resources available. I especially think that math has not been taught as intuitively or creatively as it could be and has much potential in the field of programming for educational purposes. I am always interested in ways to blend mathematics and programming and use one to help another. Programming, to visualize and compute in math, and math, to optimize and strategize programming.
